# scrap
scrapyard project
- in this project we made a completely useless flash light that only turns when the front is covered and the button is held and the environment is bright so there is already light in the area which makes this project completely useless
- the parts we used are:
- - button
  - ldr
  - led
  - arduino uno
  - breadboard
  - flying fish sensor
  - wires
  - blue cable to connect to computer
  - plastic bottle
